## frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
This project is a simple 2D game, where the player has to get to the river while avoiding enemy bugs, it was created for a Udacity front-end developer nanodegree project.

The started code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## Basic functionality
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Each time the player wins, the score is incremented by 100.
